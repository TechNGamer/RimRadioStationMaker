# RimRadioStationMaker
RimRadio Station Creation Helper (RRSCH) or RimRadio Station Maker (RRSM, original name) is a program for the modification [RimRadio](https://github.com/TechNGamer/RimRadio).
This program aids in the production of Radio Station.
This program at the moment is critical to making those Stations as the mod's JSON deserialization ability does not work.
